# How to choose a database?

I am not a DBA. I am a software engineer writing apps. When I start to research which is a good database for my app, I found very limited resources on that. So I decide to write this. Hope this can help more software engineers to choose the proper database for their apps.

RDBMS

I will start with RDBMS. This is the basic one. Without knowing whether there exists a particular database that is suitable for your app, use RDBMS. RDBMS should work for most of the apps, though it might not be the optimal solution.
